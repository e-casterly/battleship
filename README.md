# Battleship

## 🚀 Project Overview

This is my personal side project: a browser-based version of the classic **Battleship** game.  
Built with React, TypeScript and Vite.

### Key features:
- Player vs Computer (AI opponent)
- Dynamic ship placement (horizontal/vertical)
- Visual feedback: hits, misses, animations
- Theme switcher: Light / Dark / System preference
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Persistent game state and clean UX

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Place your fleet on the grid (drag-and-drop or random placement)
2. Use the grid to fire shots at the opponent’s board
3. The computer takes its turn immediately after yours
4. The game ends when one side sinks all the opponent’s ships
5. Enjoy the animation effects and feedback for hits/misses!
